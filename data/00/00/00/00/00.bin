  |   his elderly grandmother has transformed into a cute young girl!       |
  |   Hijinks ensue.                                                        |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Nineteen-year-old Yuu can't stand his younger sister, Otoko, and      |
  |   the feeling is mutual. It's been almost a year since Yuu saw her      |
  |   last, having escaped his dreary home town to study in the bustling    |
  |   city, but with the advent of New Year's he finds himself obliged to   |
  |   return to his family to celebrate.                                    |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Unfortunately, Yuu's absence has not softened his younger sister,     |
  |   and Otoko is just as sullen and surly as ever before.                 |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Finding the atmosphere at home unbearable, Yuu decides to escape      |
  |   once more - not to the city this time, but to his grandmother's       |
  |   snowy, secluded village.                                              |
  |                                                                         |
  |   The reunion between grandson and grandmother starts normally at       |
  |   first... until one moonlit night, when the pair witness a star        |
  |   streaking through the sky.                                            |
  |                                                                         |
  |   The following morning, Yuu enters the kitchen, still half-asleep,     |
  |   to discover...                                                        |
  |                                                                         |
  |   "Who are you? What are you doing in my grandmother's house"?          |
  |                                                                         |
  |   ...that his grandmother has transformed into a cute young girl!       |
  |                                                                         |
  |   What is the reason behind his grandmother's drastic change? Will      |
  |   Yuu be able to restore her to her original self? And why is she so    |
  |   adorable?!                                                            |
